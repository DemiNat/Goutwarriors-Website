                  Living with gout can take an emotional toll. The unpredictability of attacks, 
                  lifestyle changes, and social stigma can contribute to stress, anxiety, and depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important to recognize that these feelings are normal and that seeking 
                  support for your mental health is just as important as managing the physical 
                  aspects of gout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remember that taking care of your emotional well-being isn't just beneficial 
                  for your mental healthâ€”it can also help reduce inflammation and improve your 
                  overall gout management.
